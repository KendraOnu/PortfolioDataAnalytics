Welcome to my Data Analytics Repository. Here, you will find Data Analytics projects showcasing my skills in SQL and Excel. I have completed 3 projects demonstrating my understanding and skill in Basic SQL syntax for data exploration such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, Aggregate functions and CREATE DATABASE. As well as VLOOKUP, Data Sorting and Filtering and Data Visualisations (Excel).
